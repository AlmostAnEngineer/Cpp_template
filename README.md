## Simple template for C++ projects with pre-configured CMake and GTest

This C++ project template is perfect for those starting a new C++ project. With pre-configured CMake and GTest, you'll save a lot of time that you would otherwise spend configuring the project and setting up the testing environment.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository and make your changes to the code. Then, use CMake to compile and build the project. The prepared unit tests will allow you to quickly and easily test your code.

## Requirements

To use this project template, you will need:

    A C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang)
    CMake 3.0 or later
    GTest (installed or downloaded as part of the project)
## How to use this?
To use your code you need to write few commands in terminal (open terminal in same folder as CMakeLists.txt)

	cd build/ ; cmake .. ; make ; ./MyProject
